This directory contains files used in simulations replicating the 58 %VO2Max exercises reported in:

Ahlborg G, Felig P. Lactate and Glucose Exchange across the Forearm, Legs, and Splanchnic Bed during and after Prolonged Leg Exercise. Journal of Clinical Investigation. 1982;69:45â€“54.

We did simulations on 20 subjects (matching the characteristics of the human subjects studied in the paper referenced above) and this directory contains the configuraton files used for these simulations. The directory consists of a common food description file (Food.txt), a common event description file (Events58.txt) and 20 sets of exercise & parameter description files (Exercise58_*.txt and ParamsNormal58_*.txt).
