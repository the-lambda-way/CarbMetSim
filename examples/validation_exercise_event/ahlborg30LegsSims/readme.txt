This directory contains files used in simulations replicating the 30 %VO2Max "leg" exercises reported in:

Ahlborg G, Wahren J, Felig P. Splanchnic and Peripheral Glucose and Lactate Metabolism during and after Prolonged Arm Exercise. Journal of Clinical Investigation. 1986;77:690â€“699.

We did simulations on 6 subjects (matching the characteristics of the human subjects studied in the paper referenced above) and this directory contains the configuraton files used for these simulations. The directory consists of a common food description file (Food.txt), a common event description file (Events30.txt) and 6 sets of exercise & parameter description files (ExerciseLeg30_*.txt and ParamsNormalLeg30_*.txt).
